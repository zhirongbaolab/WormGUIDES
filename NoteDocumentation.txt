Note Attachment/Dislpay types documentation. The listed keywords (in qoutes) are the terms that should be used in their
corresponding fields in the StoryListConfig csv config file. All keywords are case-insensitive.

Note Attachment Type: specifies the entity that the note is attached to
"cell"          -> attachment to a cell, the cell's lineage name should be specified under the Cells column in the
                    config file
"structure"     -> attachment to a structure, the structure's scene name should be specified under the Cells column in the
                    config file
"location"      -> attachment to a location, the xyz coordinates should be specified under the xyz Location column in the
                    config file with each coordinated delimited by a space
""              -> no attachment to a specific entity/location, note defaults to be displayed in the overlay story pane in
                    the upper-right-hand corner of the 3D window

Note Display Type: specifies what the note is displayed as in the 3D window
"billboard"         -> display as a flat billboard that rotates and translates in the 3D subscene with the entity that
                        note is attached to
"billboard front"   -> display as a front-facing billboard that rotates and translates in the 3D subscene with the
                        entity that the note is attached to, except the front (with text legible) always faces the user
"sprite"            -> display as a sprite that remains constant in size and front-facing on a plane on top of the
                        3D window, this moves with the entity in the subscene that the note is attached to
"callout UL"        -> display as a sprite offset to the upper left of the entity that the note is attached to. A line
                        is drawn from the note to the left side of the entity. Optional horizontal/vertical offsets can be
                        defined under the Callout Tag
"callout UR"        -> display as a sprite offset to the upper right of the entity that the note is attached to. A line

""                  -> no display type, defaults to the overlay display

Callout Tag Offsets (Horizontal/Vertical): number of pixels the callout tag should be offset (horizontally/vertically)
from the subscene entity

XYZ location: the location (defined by the x, y, and z positions) in the subscene where a tag should be displayed
